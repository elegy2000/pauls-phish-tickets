### Current Issues
- CSV upload functionality not working
  - Error: "Method not allowed" and "Error inserting tickets into Supabase"
  - Fixed by:
    * Added environment variables for authentication
    * Enhanced CSV validation with detailed error messages
    * Improved error handling throughout the upload process
    * Updated cookie settings for better compatibility
    * Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on ticket_stubs table
    * **[May 20, 2024] Fixed RLS policy to allow inserts from API/service for CSV upload (see below)**
  - Next steps:
    * Test CSV upload with new validation
    * Monitor error messages for any remaining issues
- Website is limited to 1000 tickets due to Supabase client default; needs batch fetching/pagination everywhere tickets are loaded.
- CSV upload can create duplicate entries in the Supabase table; deduplication logic needs to be enforced on upload and/or at the database level.
- CSV download includes the 'id' column, which is not needed for user uploads
  - Planned: Update CSV download logic to exclude the 'id' column so exported CSVs only contain relevant ticket fields (year, date, venue, city_state, imageurl, net_link)

### In Progress
- [x] Test CSV upload with enhanced validation
  - Completed: July 2024
  - CSV upload now validates all fields and provides detailed error messages. No issues found in latest tests.

  - CSV download now excludes 'id' column. Confirmed in exported files.
- [x] Images not displaying despite being present in Supabase Storage (ongoing bug, under investigation)

### Migration to Supabase Auth 

## [January 24, 2025] - Storage Cleanup System Implementation

**‚úÖ RESOLVED - Storage Optimization**
- **Issue:** Supabase storage contained ~95 unused files (55MB) including timestamp-prefixed duplicates and unused original images
- **Root Cause:** Image upload process created duplicate files with timestamp prefixes, plus unused files from testing/migration
- **Analysis:** 
  - 40 duplicate files with timestamp prefixes (37.76MB)
  - 55 unused original files not referenced by any tickets (17.24MB)
  - 1,349 properly used images (528MB)
- **Solution:** 
  - Created `/api/cleanup-unused-images` endpoint for safe batch deletion
  - Added "Storage Cleanup" section to admin Settings tab
  - Implemented smart detection of unused files and timestamp duplicates
  - Added confirmation dialogs and detailed result reporting
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Database query to identify referenced vs unreferenced image files
  - Regex pattern matching for timestamp-prefixed duplicates
  - Batch deletion (50 files per batch) with error handling
  - Real-time UI feedback with success/error states
- **Result:** Successfully freed ~55MB of storage space, improved storage efficiency
- **Files Modified:** `pages/admin.jsx`, `pages/api/cleanup-unused-images.js`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED - Cleanup tool now available in admin dashboard
